# Logistic Regression from Scratch (Math + Numpy) 

This repository is my full implementaton of **Binary Logistic Regression** includes :

- Full implementation of logistic regression with **Numpy** 
- **L1(Lasso)** & **L2(Ridge)** Regularization 
- Applied to the **Heart Disease dataset**
- Step-by-Step **Jupyter Notebook** with explanations
- **PDF documentation** of Logistic Regression math and theory
- Benchmark comparison with `sickit-learn` 

All as part of my journey studying **Machine Learning.**
